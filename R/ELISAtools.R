###ELISA tools, an R software package for analyzing ELISA data and 
#	doing batch effect correction.
#	By Feng @ BU 07/01/2018 Boston University (ffeng@bu.edu)
#
#  Version 0.1.5
#  For now, 1)it will only fit either the five- or four-parameter logistic model
#  2)do analysis to predicate based on the calibration the unknown concentration
#  3)if there are batches, will fit to estimate the shift factor and do correction/normalization

#' @title ELISA data analysis with batch correction
#'
#' @description An R package to run ELISA data analysis 
#'		with the ability to do batch correction/normalization 
#'		
#'
#' @details This package is developed to run analysis of ELISA data. 
#'		First, the calibration data are used to fit either the five- or
#'		four-parameter logistic model. Then the fitted model is
#'		used to predict the concentrations of unknown samples.
#'		If the batches of calibration data exist, 
#'		the correction/normalization could be done. The corrected
#'		calibration curve are then used for predication.

#' 		Please refer to the vignettes to see details.
