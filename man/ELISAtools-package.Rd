\title{ELISA data analysis with batch correction}
\description{
An R package to run ELISA data analysis 
	with the ability to do batch correction/normalization
}
\details{
This package is defined to run analysis of ELISA data. 
	First, the caliration data are used to fit either five- or
	four-parameter logistic model. Then the fitted model is
	used to predict the concentrations of unknown samples.
	If the batches of calibration data exist, 
	the correction/normalization could be done. The corrected
	calibration curve are then used for predication.

		Please refer to the vignettes to see details.
